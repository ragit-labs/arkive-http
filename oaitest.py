This is similar to PDA -- an acronym for Pichda, Dalit and Alpasankhyak (minorities) -- coined by the former Apna Dal (K) ally Samajwadi Party.\nLucknow: AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi and Pallavi Patel of Apna Dal (K) during a joint press conference, in Lucknow, Sunday (PTI)\n\nLok Sabha Polls 2024: On Sunday, Apna Dal (Kamerawadi) announced that they are exiting the INDIA bloc. Apna Dal (K) leader Pallavi Patel announced a new joint front with Asaduddin Owaisi's AIMIM, which will contest the Lok Sabha polls. \n\nThe two opposition parties floated the PDM Nyay Morcha, calling it a front to bring justice to Pichda (backwards), Dalits and Muslims. This is similar to PDA -- an acronym for Pichda, Dalit and Alpasankhyak (minorities) -- coined by the former Apna Dal (K) ally Samajwadi Party.\n\nPallavi Patel informed that Apna Dal (K) ceased to remain an ally of Akhilesh Yadav's Samajwadi Party. \n\nShe also said that her party's alliance with the SP does not exist anymore and blamed Akhilesh Yadav for the breakup.\n\nPallavi Patel told PTI that it was SP chief Akhilesh Yadav who said that the alliance with Apna Dal was for the 2022 Assembly elections, and not for the Lok Sabha polls.\n\n"We were invited by the Congress to be a part of the INDI alliance and they should have made it clear whether we are a part of the INDIA bloc or not? But the Congress did not take much interest," Pallavi Patel said.\n\nPallavi Patel along with her mother Krishna Patel, All India Majlis-E-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief Owaisi and leaders of other political parties held a joint press conference to announce the formation of the PDM Nyay Morcha.\n\nPallavi Patel also indicated that Owaisi can look after the interests of Muslims better than SP chief Yadav.\n\n"Without this (PDM) 'morcha', no government will be formed in the country," Pallavi Patel told reporters.\n\nAsked if the A in PDA was replaced with M due to Owaisi, Pallavi Patel said, "If this is the result of the company of Owaisi sahab, then what is the harm in it? The fight for social justice should be fought with transparency."\n\n"There was confusion surrounding the alphabet A as in some cases, it stood for 'aadhi aabaadi' (half the population), sometimes it was 'agrhaa' (upper caste), sometimes it stood for 'alpasankhyak' (minorities) and sometimes, it stood for 'Adivasi' (tribals)," she added.\n\n"I am of the view that there should not be any confusion in politics. So, to remove the confusion about A, we have worked to make those (people) join, who have been victims of social, economic and political exploitation," she said.\n\nCurrently, Pallavi Patel is an SP MLA from the Sirathu Assembly constituency in Kaushambi district.\n\n \n\nUnlock a world of Benefits!
